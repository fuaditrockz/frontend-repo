## Technical Test Requirements

✅ Create a Frontend Repository

✅ Repository Name: frontend-repo

✅ Framework: Next.js

✅ UI Library: React MUI

✅ Directory Structure

- Create the following folders: apis, components, store.

✅ Setup Redux

- Configure Redux for state management.

✅ Button and update data API Integration

- Button: Create a button to trigger the backend endpoint.
- API Abstraction: Ensure proper abstraction for API calls.
- State Management: Use Redux to manage and display the state of the update process, including loading, success, and error messages using Typography.

✅ Display label with fetch data API Integration using SSR

❌ FE repo able to test API calling locally using Firebase Emulator

- I'm utilize the [backend-repo](https://github.com/fuaditrockz/backend-repo) to handle the backend on this project. Because I was in a hurry to finish this on time and didn't understand the instructions (I was confused about whether part 1 and part 2 were continuous or not). Because if so, there will be redundant endpoints during the demo.
